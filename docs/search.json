    "text": "I became interested in coding when my undergraduate adviser recommended that I take a computer science class, since in Astronomy there is a lot of data analysis. There I discovered that coding was just a lot of puzzle solving, and it really ignited my passion for problem-solving, especially in coding. From there, I minored in Computer Science and ultimately decided that I wanted to get a masters degree in data analytics. I then enrolled in UMass Amherst’s Data Analytics and Computation Social Science program, and I am in my last semester.\nI am really excited to apply the skills and tools that I have learned. My experiences in this program as well as with astronomy have shown me that I enjoy data processing and analysis, regardless of the discipline."
