I am passionate about problem-solving, and I am excited to explore the different ways I can apply the knowledge and skills that I have learned in my college career. I am searching for a data-focused job that will help me explore and build upon those skills.

I became interested in coding when my undergraduate adviser recommended that I take a computer science class, since in Astronomy there is a lot of data analysis. There I discovered that coding was just a lot of puzzle solving, and it really ignited my passion for problem-solving, especially in coding. From there, I minored in Computer Science and ultimately decided that I wanted to get a masters degree in data analytics. I then enrolled in UMass Amherst's Data Analytics and Computation Social Science program, and I am in my last semester.

I am really excited to apply the skills and tools that I have learned. My experiences in this program as well as with astronomy have shown me that I enjoy data processing and analysis, regardless of the discipline.
